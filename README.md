# PathwiseAurora

**PathwiseAurora** turns complex decision processes and “what if?” scenarios into clear, guided paths your team can actually follow.  
Instead of scattered knowledge in people’s heads, Slack threads, or static docs, you get a single interactive playbook for decisions and actions.

## What can you use it for?

### Designing decision flows and playbooks

- **Define process steps** – each node represents a concrete step, question, or state  
  (e.g. “Customer reports an issue”, “Payment rejected”, “Decision: discount or escalation?”).
- **Add choices** – every step can offer multiple options that lead further  
  (e.g. “VIP customer” → one path, “new customer” → another).
- **Create hierarchical structures** – build main flows and smaller sub-scenarios  
  (e.g. “Handling complaints” → “Physical product” → “Damaged in transit”).
- **Keep things consistent** – the app helps you avoid “dangling” steps, empty fields, or dead ends.

### Two ways to view your process

- **List view** – great when you want to refine wording, update steps, and quickly edit content.
- **Tile view** – a more visual map of your process, perfect for workshops, reviews, and onboarding.

### Interactive runner – like a guided scenario

- **Simulate the journey** – walk through the process the same way a customer, agent, analyst, or engineer would.
- **Step-by-step decisions** – pick options and see exactly where they lead, like an interactive story.
- **Session history** – move back a step or jump directly to a specific point in the flow at any time.
- **Share specific points** – easily start a discussion from a particular step instead of “somewhere in the middle”.

### Finding the right step fast

- **Search and filter** – quickly find a node by ID, title, or content  
  (e.g. “chargeback”, “escalation”, “VIP”).
- **Get back to the big picture** – clear the filter with a single shortcut and see the full process again.

### Working with shared knowledge

- **Automatic saving** – your changes are stored in the browser as you work, so you don’t lose progress.
- **Import** – load existing flows prepared by you or another team (e.g. incident response runbooks, sales playbooks).
- **Export** – save your flow to a file so you can:
  - share it with other teams,
  - commit it to a repository,
  - archive different process versions,
  - reuse it in other tools.

### User experience

- **Clear split layout** – “design” panel on one side, “run the scenario” panel on the other.
- **Editable flow title** – name your process in business language  
  (e.g. “B2B Complaints Handling Path”).
- **Live status indicator** – see at a glance whether the process is complete or still has gaps.
- **Workshop-friendly** – adjust steps in real time while walking through the flow together in a meeting.
