# PathwiseAurora
**Pathrise** is an interactive editor for branching debugging and decision flows. You build a graph of nodes (steps, questions, decisions) and run through it like an interactive script – with history, back/forward, validation, and JSON import/export. All in a single vanilla HTML file with autosave via `localStorage`.
