Add functionality to generate email summaries from session exports in both
plain text and HTML formats. Users can now create ready-to-use email content
from their session history without manual transcription.

- Step-by-step history with comments and tags

Implementation details:
- New EmailSummaryGenerator utility (src/utils/EmailSummaryGenerator.js)
- Extended ImportExportService with showEmailSummary() method
- Added "Email Summary" button in header
- Modal UI with dark theme styling
- Full integration with existing session export flow

Files changed:
- Added: src/utils/EmailSummaryGenerator.js
- Modified: src/services/ImportExportService.js
- Modified: src/controllers/AppController.js
- Modified: src/ui/DOMRegistry.js

This addresses the user story requirement for generating email summaries
from session exports to share with clients, managers, or tickets.
